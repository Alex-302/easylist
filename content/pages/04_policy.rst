EasyList policy
---------------
- Purpose
	- EasyList filters must remove `adverts </2011/07/11/the-definition-of-advert-and-link-exchange-policy.html>`_, although it is acceptable for them to incidentally remove tracking.
	- Self-promotion should not be specifically removed by EasyList, although equally should not be allowed if it is blocked.
	- Adverts must be blocked regardless of the reasons for their presence or the purpose that the money raised ultimately serves.
	- `Ads caused by malware or adware extensions or plugins on your computer will not be fixed </2013/03/09/ads-caused-by-malware-or-adware-extensions-or-plugins.html>`_.

- Filter evaluation
	- Evidence should be provided that filters need to be added to the subscription.
	- Specific filters should only added if a substantial amount of advertising is removed by its inclusion.
	- Consistently problematic filters should be removed from the subscription.
	- `Anti-Adblock should only be challenged if the system limits website functionality or causes significant disruption to browsing </2013/05/10/anti-adblock-guide-for-site-admins.html>`_.
	
- Coverage
	- Filters should only be added for English websites; supplements support other languages.
	- If it is not feasible for a supplement to override EasyList filters should be added to the primary subscription.
	- Languages for which there are no supplements may have issues resolved in EasyList; however, these filters should ideally be transferred to another subscription.

- Syntax
	- Domains specifically serving adverts should be blocked on all third-party websites.
	- Filters must be as efficient as possible.
	- Only element rules based on id or class should be applied to all domains, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
	- Allowlists should be specific enough to avoid protecting unwanted items.
